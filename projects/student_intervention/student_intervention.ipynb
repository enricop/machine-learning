    "Considering that the student dataset is small with a large set of features, its not unexpected to get a lot of noise or statistically irrelevant results.\n",
    "The curse of dimensionality applies to every supervised algorithm. Since every machine learning algorithm is trying to find patterns, they all need to look at the interactions between every possible combination of features. The set of combinations of variables grows exponentially with the number of features. This isn't true of something like linear regression, but it is true of SVMs, Neural Networks, Decision Trees, and anything that can represent arbitrary functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this problem also we have limited resources where space, learning, and query time all matter, not just prevision performance. By looking into the complexity of each of the three model it can serve as a basic heuristic to reduce one or more of these costs as much as possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "To assess if our prediction is reasonable, besides from comparing it with the median, the mean and checking if it is included in one standard deviation range, we can use SKlearn functions to find the nearest neighbours of the feature vector.

    "  - classification of images\n",
    "  - Hand-written characters can be recognition.\n",
    "  - biological and other sciences. They have been used to classify proteins with up to 90% of the compounds classified correctly\n",
    "\n",
    "Support vector machines use optimal margin classifier to create margins that separate data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Rather than linear classifiers, that use the vector θ to desribe the parameters for the margins, SVM use parameters vectors w, b, and write the classifier as h(x) = g(w' * x + b). The decision boundary (the line separating the positive and negative examples) corresponding to is given by: (w, b). The vector w is orthogonal (at 90◦) to the separating hyperplane.\n",
    "Solving a constrained optimization problem it is possible the obtain the parameters that maximizes the margin. SVM use a quadratic optimization problem to avoid ‘local minimum’ issues of neural nets for example. The solutions define \"support vectors\" can be used, with a product of the input data, to make predictions. Support vectors lie on the few data points closest to the decision boundary (or hyperplane).\n",
    "\n",
    "The notion of kernels then give a way to apply SVMs efficiently in very high dimensional feature spaces. “kernel functions” offer a new efficient separability of non-linear regions. They are a generalization of ‘similarity’ to new kinds of similarity measures based on dot products.\n",
    "”kernel function” defines inner products in the transformed space. Or, it defines similarity in the transformed space. The idea is to gain linearly separation by mapping the data to a higher dimensional space. A set, for example, might not be separated by a linear function, but can be separated by a quadratic one.\n",
    "\n",
    "With SVM there can be lots of input features. Feature scaling is very important for SVM when we use non linear kernels, expecially before using the Gaussian Kernel. Scaling all of the features such that they have mean zero and unit variance greatly helps with the performance of SVM, since each feature can be compared equivalently to the others, giving better results in dot products.\n",
    "\n",
    "We also have to choose the 'C' parameter for regularization for obtaining the decision boundary. When we wish to regularize more (reduce overfitting), we decrease C, and when we wish to regularize less (reduce underfitting), we increase C.\n",
    "This large margin is only achieved when C is very large. Data is linearly separable when a straight line can separate the positive and negative examples. If we have outlier examples that we don't want to affect the decision boundary, then we can reduce C. We could also train C and the parameters for the kernel function using the training and cross-validation datasets.\n",

    "One way to reduce the variance is local averaging: instead of just one neighbor, we find K and average their predictions.\n",

    "\n",

Since the board of supervisors has asked the most effective model that uses the least amount of computation costs to save on the budget, we can use SVM over KNN. KNN also needs to keep in memory all the input data, which might be a problem if students increase a lot. SVM is memory efficient.\n",
    " - KNN is twice as expensive as SVM for making predictions on new data. This is an online/realtime service, so we might get many queries per second. The prediction time should be low.\n",

    "The untuned model has a testing F1 score fo 0.7368\n",
    "\n",
    "The model has a relatively high score on training data but falls below the score fo the untuned model.\n",
    "There is no absolute guarantee that grid search will always find the absolute best model. This depends on not only choosing the correct metric and number of parameters in grid space, but if the sample size of the training data is sufficiently large enough to not only to train the model but also big enough to validate on.\n",
    "In this case grid search will determine the best model from the average score from training the model on two points and using one point as the validation. However as mentioned above if we have very few points to begin with and a lot of features, it wouldn't be statistically significant.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ordinary single split cross validation (rather than k-fold) doesn't give an accurate measure of the performance of the algorithm for this small a dataset. Indeed we find that what looked like the best model turned out to be the worst when we checked it using GridSearchCV (it was just the most accurate model on that particular data split but performed much worse on other splits).\n",
    "\n",
    "The grid search algorithm exhaustively considers all parameter combinations of learning algorithm of the \"validation set\" to be able to tune or optimize the algorithm configuration.\n",
    "In particular the grid search technique is configured with a grid that specifiess how the search method computes the parameters in the ranges chosen for the model.\n",
    "The parameter C, common to all SVM kernels, trades off misclassification of training examples against simplicity of the decision surface. A low C makes the decision surface smooth, while a high C aims at classifying all training examples correctly. Gamma defines how much influence a single training example has. The larger gamma is, the closer other examples must be to be affected.\n",
    "Proper choice of C and gamma is critical to the SVM’s performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also by partitioning the available data like before question 2, we reduce the number of samples which can be used for learning the model, and the model prevision score can depend on a particular random choice for the pair of (train, validation) sets. A solution to this problem is a procedure called cross-validation (CV for short). A test set should still be held out for final evaluation, but the validation set is no longer needed when doing CV.\n",
    "In the basic approach, called k-fold CV, the training set is split into k smaller sets. The following procedure is followed for each of the k “folds”:\n",
    " -  A model is trained using \"k-1\" of the folds as training data;\n",
    " -  the resulting model is validated on the remaining part of the data (i.e., it is used as a test set to compute a performance measure such as accuracy).  \n",
    "\n",
    "The performance measure reported by k-fold cross-validation is then the average of the values computed in the loop. This approach can be computationally expensive, but does not waste too much data (as it is the case when fixing an arbitrary test set)."
