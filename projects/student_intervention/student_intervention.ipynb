    " - features are 31\n",
    "\n",
    "Considering that the student dataset is small with a large set of features, its not unexpected to get a lot of noise or statistically irrelevant results.\n",
    "The curse of dimensionality applies to every supervised algorithm. Since every machine learning algorithm is trying to find patterns, they all need to look at the interactions between every possible combination of features. The set of combinations of variables grows exponentially with the number of features. This isn't true of something like linear regression, but it is true of SVMs, Neural Networks, Decision Trees, and anything that can represent arbitrary functions.\n",
    "\n",

    "the general applications for this model are:\n",
    "  - classification of images\n",
    "  - Hand-written characters can be recognition.\n",
    "  - biological and other sciences. They have been used to classify proteins with up to 90% of the compounds classified correctly\n",
    "\n",
    "Support vector machines use optimal margin classifier to create margins that separate data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Rather than linear classifiers, that use the vector θ to desribe the parameters for the margins, SVM use parameters vectors w, b, and write the classifier as h(x) = g(w' * x + b). The decision boundary (the line separating the positive and negative examples) corresponding to is given by: (w, b). The vector w is orthogonal (at 90◦) to the separating hyperplane.\n",
    "Solving a constrained optimization problem it is possible the obtain the parameters that maximizes the margin. SVM use a quadratic optimization problem to avoid ‘local minimum’ issues of neural nets for example. The solutions define \"support vectors\" can be used, with a product of the input data, to make predictions. Support vectors lie on the few data points closest to the decision boundary (or hyperplane).\n",
    "\n",
    "The notion of kernels then give a way to apply SVMs efficiently in very high dimensional feature spaces. “kernel functions” offer a new efficient separability of non-linear regions. They are a generalization of ‘similarity’ to new kinds of similarity measures based on dot products.\n",
    "”kernel function” defines inner products in the transformed space. Or, it defines similarity in the transformed space. The idea is to gain linearly separation by mapping the data to a higher dimensional space. A set, for example, might not be separated by a linear function, but can be separated by a quadratic one.\n",
    "\n",
    "With SVM there can be lots of input features. Feature scaling is very important for SVM when we use non linear kernels, expecially before using the Gaussian Kernel. Scaling all of the features such that they have mean zero and unit variance greatly helps with the performance of SVM, since each feature can be compared equivalently to the others, giving better results in dot products.\n",
    "\n",
    "We also have to choose the 'C' parameter for regularization for obtaining the decision boundary. When we wish to regularize more (reduce overfitting), we decrease C, and when we wish to regularize less (reduce underfitting), we increase C.\n",
    "This large margin is only achieved when C is very large. Data is linearly separable when a straight line can separate the positive and negative examples. If we have outlier examples that we don't want to affect the decision boundary, then we can reduce C. We could also train C and the parameters for the kernel function using the training and cross-validation datasets.\n",

    "One way to reduce the variance is local averaging: instead of just one neighbor, we find K and average their predictions.\n",
    "New instances are compared to the training data itself to make a classification or  regression judgment. Lazy learners have advantages in local scale estimation and easy integration of additional training data.\n",
    "\n",
    " - The training time for KNN is fast compared with linear regresion with has to obtain coefficients.\n",
    " - KNN have higher memory requirements since it stores all the training data, and linear regression only stores function coefficients.\n",
    " - Prediction time is slower in KNN than linear regression because new instances must be fit to the whole data set.\n",

    " - Because it cost money to run these algorithms on a third party vendor's computers, we need to consider not just the F1 score performance, but the computation resources each algorithm needs to use. Since the board of supervisors has asked the most effective model that uses the least amount of computation costs to save on the budget, we can use Neural Networks over KNN. KNN also needs to keep in memory all the input data, which might be a problem if students increase a lot. Neural Network is more memory efficient.\n",
    " - KNN is three times as expensive as Neural Network for making predictions on new data. This is an online/realtime service, so we might get many queries per second. The prediction time should be low.\n",

    "There is no absolute guarantee that grid search will always find better model parameters. This depends on not only choosing the correct metric and number of parameters in grid space, but if the sample size of the training data is sufficiently large enough to not only to train the model but also big enough to validate on.\n",
    "In this case grid search will determine the best model from the average score from training the model on training points and using test point as the validation. However as mentioned above if we have very few points to begin with and a lot of features, it wouldn't be statistically significant.\n",
    "\n",
    "The grid search algorithm exhaustively considers all parameter combinations of learning algorithm of the \"validation set\" to be able to tune or optimize the algorithm configuration.\n",
    "In particular the grid search technique is configured with a grid that specifiess how the search method computes the parameters in the ranges chosen for the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also by partitioning the available data as done before question 2, we reduce the number of samples which can be used for learning the model, and the model prevision score can depend on a particular random choice for the pair of (train, validation) sets. A solution to this problem is a procedure called cross-validation (CV for short). A test set should still be held out for final evaluation, but the validation set is no longer needed when doing CV.\n",
    "In the basic approach, called k-fold CV, the training set is split into k smaller sets. The following procedure is followed for each of the k “folds”:\n",
    " -  A model is trained using \"k-1\" of the folds as training data;\n",
    " -  the resulting model is validated on the remaining part of the data (i.e., it is used as a test set to compute a performance measure such as accuracy).  \n",
    "\n",
    "The performance measure reported by k-fold cross-validation is then the average of the values computed in the loop. This approach can be computationally expensive, but does not waste too much data (as it is the case when fixing an arbitrary test set)."
